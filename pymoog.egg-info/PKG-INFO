        > We present you a black-box.
        
        `pymoog` is a python3 wrapper for running the LTE spectrum synthesis part of the code [MOOG](https://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html) by Chris Sneden.
        The synthetic spectra from optical to near infrared region of the model stars in Kurucz model ATLAS can be generated by `pymoog` in a few commands.
        This package can be run in Linux or Mac system.

        There is also [a stand-alone version](https://github.com/MingjieJian/moog_nosm) of the MOOG used here.
