> We present you a black-box.

`pymoog` is a python3 wrapper for running the LTE spectrum synthesis part of the code [MOOG](https://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html) by Chris Sneden.
The synthetic spectra from optical to near infrared region of the model stars in Kurucz model ATLAS can be generated by `pymoog` in a few commands.
This package can be run in Linux or Mac system.
